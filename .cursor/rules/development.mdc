# Development Workflow

## Memory Bank Maintenance

The memory bank (`.cursor/memory-bank/`) is a **living document** that must be kept synchronized with the codebase.

### When to Update Memory Bank

1. **At start of significant task**: Update `activeContext.md` with current focus
2. **After completing features/PRs**: Update `progress.md` with what's been built
3. **When architecture changes**: Update `systemPatterns.md` with new patterns
4. **When technologies added**: Update `techContext.md` with new dependencies
5. **When project goals shift**: Update `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`
6. **At start of each epic**: Review and update `activeContext.md`

### Memory Bank Update Workflow

**During Development**:
- Update `activeContext.md` to reflect current work
- Document decisions and considerations

**After Feature Completion**:
- Update `progress.md` with completed items
- Update `activeContext.md` with next steps
- Document any new patterns in `systemPatterns.md`

**Before Major Decisions**:
- Review relevant memory bank files
- Ensure context is current

**At Epic Completion**:
- Comprehensive update of `progress.md`
- Update `activeContext.md` with next epic focus
- Document any architectural changes

### Memory Bank Files

- `projectbrief.md`: Project goals, scope, success criteria
- `productContext.md`: Why project exists, user experience goals
- `activeContext.md`: Current work focus, recent changes, next steps
- `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture, design patterns, technical decisions
- `techContext.md`: Technologies, setup, dependencies
- `progress.md`: What works, what's left, current status

**Rule**: Always check memory bank files at the start of significant tasks to understand current context.

## PR Structure

### Epic-Based Organization

Work is organized into **epics**, each containing multiple PRs:

- Epic 0: Cursor Rules & Memory Bank Setup
- Epic 1: Foundation & Configuration
- Epic 2: Navigation & Layout Refinements
- Epic 3: Atomic Reusable UI Components
- Epic 4: Page Sections
- Epic 5: Page Implementation
- Epic 6: Routing & Integration
- Epic 7: Polish, Accessibility & Deployment

### PR Guidelines

- **Small and Focused**: 1-4 commits per PR
- **Single Purpose**: Each PR addresses one feature or concern
- **Reviewable**: Easy to review and understand
- **Atomic**: Can be merged independently

### PR Structure

```
PR X.Y: [Feature Name]
- Commit 1: [Description]
- Commit 2: [Description]
- Commit 3: [Description]
```

## Commit Conventions

### Commit Message Format

```
[Type]: [Brief description]

[Optional longer description]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
feat: Add ProjectCard component with thumbnail and tags

- Accepts Project type props
- Displays thumbnail, title, description
- Tag badges with color coding
- Demo and repo action buttons
```

```
fix: Update Navbar to use config-driven navigation

- Import navLinks from navigation.ts
- Map over navLinks instead of hard-coded items
- Add active state styling
```

## Code Review Process

### Before Submitting PR

1. Run `npm run lint` - fix any linting errors
2. Run `npm run build` - ensure build succeeds
3. Test manually in browser
4. Update memory bank if needed
5. Ensure all commits follow conventions

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows SOLID principles
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] Components are modular and reusable
- [ ] No hard-coded values (use config/data)
- [ ] Memory bank updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages are clear

## Testing Approach

### Current State

- Manual testing in browser
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint for code quality

### Future Enhancements

- Unit tests with Vitest
- Component tests with React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress

## Development Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- Feature branches: `feature/epic-X-feature-name`
- Branch from `main`, merge back via PR

### Commit Frequency

- Commit after each logical unit of work
- Small, atomic commits preferred
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive

## Documentation Standards

### Code Comments

- JSDoc comments for components and complex functions
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic
- Avoid obvious comments

### Component Documentation

```typescript
/**
 * ComponentName component
 * Brief description of what it does
 *
 * Features:
 * - Feature 1
 * - Feature 2
 *
 * @component
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <ComponentName prop1={value} />
 * ```
 */
```

## Quality Assurance

### Before Merging

- [ ] All tests pass (when tests exist)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] ESLint passes
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Memory bank updated
- [ ] Code follows project patterns

### Code Quality

- Follow SOLID principles
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Keep components small and focused
- Avoid code duplication
- Use config/data instead of hard-coding
